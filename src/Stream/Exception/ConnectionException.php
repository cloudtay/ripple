/**
 * @internal
 *
 * Internal control-flow exception used exclusively by the reactor to terminate connections.
 * This exception should NEVER be caught by user code or extended by application-level exceptions.
 *
 * When this exception is thrown, it signals that the connection must be immediately closed
 * and all related event monitoring must be cancelled. The reactor's exception boundary
 * will catch this exception, perform cleanup, and emit onClose events.
 *
 * User code should use onClose, onReadableEnd, and onWritableEnd events to handle
 * connection lifecycle events instead of catching this exception.
