|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     `libev`     |       🟢        |      🟢️      | Event extension `Ev` is a more efficient event extension that performs consistently in various systems and is recommended to be used |
|    `Native`     |        ️        |      🟢       |                                                 Support pure PHP without extensions                                                  |
